# ZCallLogs
Android application that showing outgoing calls statistics in an interactive chart dividing by Mobile network operators at Egypt.

I used what I learned from some lessons at Google Udacity Scholarship to build this small app.

First: I used Content Provider query parameters to get only needed data instead of retrieving all of the data from the database.

Second: I used Loader and cached the data so if user choice the same period time again, the app doesn't load it again.
